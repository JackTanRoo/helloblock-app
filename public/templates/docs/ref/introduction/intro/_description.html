<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>HelloBlock provides node hosting for both MainNet and TestNet, and give HTTPS access to Blockchain Data through a RESTful JSON API.</p>

<p>It is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and meaningful HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We support cross-origin resource sharing to allow client-side web application communication. The codebase is open source.</p>
<p>This is the API weâ€™ve always wanted. We hope you will love it too.</p>
